<h2>Chapter 02 </h2>
<h3>Blinking the LEDs in a more controlled way !</h3>
<h4>Page  9</h4>
<h5></h5>
<b></b>
  
<br><br>
The function inportb(port_address) returns the data on port. The data which was sent last time and which got latched on the port, can be retrived by this function.
<br><br> The main use of this function is to get input data from a give port, but if a port is an &quot;output-only&quot; port, then this function returns the last value sent to the port, which was latched.
<br><br>
old_data = inportb(PP);
<br><br> will give us the data sent last time.

<br><br> Using this function <b>can you modify the previous program</b>, to add a third option for the user.

<br>Give 3 options to the user for each LED
<br>
<br>Now, develop a program, which asks eight questions:
<ol>
	<li>Do You want to switch ON LED# 1 ? Yes/No/Toggle
	<li>Do You want to switch ON LED# 2 ? Yes/No/Toggle
	<li>Do You want to switch ON LED# 3 ? Yes/No/Toggle
	<li>....
	<li>....
	<li>....
	<li>....
	<li>Do You want to switch ON LED# 8 ? Yes/No/Toggle
</ol>
  <br>
<br><br> By using the third option the user can change the state of the LED. 
<br>Here <b>Toggle</b> means invert the previous state of LED: 
<br>Switch it ON if it was OFF
<br>Switch it OFF if it was ON
<br>But the user might even don’t know whether it was ON or OFF
<br><br> The solution is given on next page

<br>HINT: 

<ol>
	<li>Remember XOR ?
	<li>AND is used to forcibly &quot;zero-out&quot; a bit
	<li>OR&nbsp; is used to forcibly &quot;set&quot; a bit
	<li>XOR is used to forcibly &quot;complement&quot; a bit
</ol>
